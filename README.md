# Playing around with AwoX SML-c9 smart bulbs over web bluetooth

Thanks to these codes https://github.com/dragouf/awox-smartlight/blob/master/src/lib.js#L7-L13
I could turn on and off two SML-c9 smart bulbs. It's very primitive now, but I will add some
color and an blinking alarm feature. I am Deaf so I will definitively use this myself!

You'll need Chrome for that. I work with Chrome Canary. And first you'll need to delete your
bulb from the standard AwoX app.
