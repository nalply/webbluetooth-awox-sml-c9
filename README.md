# Playing around with AwoX SML-c9 smart bulbs over web bluetooth

Thanks to these codes https://github.com/dragouf/awox-smartlight/blob/987b3c6dad0e650290548c4465498261abe64592/src/lib.js#L7-L13 I could turn on and off two SML-c9 smart bulbs and setting color, at least partially. I plan these features:
- Turn on and off (done)
- RGB color from a color wheel (works partially)
- White color temperature
- Run color sequences
- Alarm feature (start a color sequence at a pretedermined time)

I am Deaf so I will definitively use this myself to get up in the morning!

You'll need Chrome for that. I work with Chrome Canary. And first you'll need to delete your bulb from the standard AwoX app. Additionally Chrome must be running during color sequences. This means, if your laptop is sleeping the alarm feature won't work.
